# Angular Project with Bootstrap

# :vulcan_salute: Hello there! 


The main idea of this project is to practice the concepts of property binding, dependency injection, @Input e @Output. They are new concepts to me so, still improving the code... . The project is divided in 8 steps. In the `app.component.html` the codes are commented and divided in blocks.  I left most part commented as they are related to different activities.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2 and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) version 5.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
